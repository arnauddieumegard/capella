#Common messages


#Common messages before explanation (should be ended by a space)
ElementNotTransitioned=''{0}'' {1} is not transitioned. 
ElementTransitioned=''{0}'' {1} is transitioned to ''{2}'' {3}. 
ElementAttached=''{0}'' is attached to ''{1}''. 
ElementMoved=''{0}'' is moved to ''{1}''. 
ElementTransitionedAndAttached=''{0}'' {1} is transitioned to ''{2}'' {3} and attached to ''{4}''. 
ElementTransitionedToExistingElement=''{0}'' is transitioned to an existing element ''{1}''

#Explaination to transition failure
SubFunctionAlreadyTransitioned=All sub-functions are already transitioned.
ContainerNotTransitioned=Container isn't transitioned.
BothBoundNotTransitioned=Both bounds ''{0}'' and ''{1}'' aren't transitioned.
TargetBoundNotTransitioned=Target bound ''{0}'' isn't transitioned.
SourceBoundNotTransitioned=Source bound ''{0}'' isn't transitioned.
InvolvedElementNotTransitioned=Involved element ''{0}'' isn't transitioned.

TargetBoundHasBeenChanged=Target bound of ''{0}'' has been replaced from ''{1}'' to ''{2}''.
SourceBoundHasBeenChanged=Source bound of ''{0}'' has been replaced from ''{1}'' to ''{2}''.

#Debug messages
RetrieveElement=Browse ''{0}''. Related elements are ''{1}''.
RetrieveElementNullElement=Browse ''{0}'' has retrieved a null element.
OutOfScope=Element ''{0}'' is not in the scope of the transition.
SourceNull=Source is null.
TargetNull=Target is null.
Null=null
TypeNotTransitioned=Type ''{0}'' isn't transitioned.
TypeTransitionedToPackage=Type ''{0}'' is transitioned to a package.

ComponentWasTransitionedToPackage=The component ''{0}'' was previously transitioned to a package. It will be (re)transitioned to a component but some inconsistencies should exists. Owned parts of the component were owned by the root component instead of component.
ComponentAlreadyTransitionedToComponent=The component ''{0}'' is already transitioned to a component.
ConnectionMovedToBetterParent=The container of the connection ''{0}'' has been transitioned to a component package. The connection will be moved to a parent component.
ContainerTransitionedToPackage=Container ''{0}'' is transitioned to a package.

IsFinal=Element ''{0}'' is final.

EndNotTransitioned=A related end is not transitioned.
EventNotTransitioned=Related event is not transitioned.
RelatedFunctionalExchangeConveyNoExchangeItem=The functional exchange doesn't convey any exchange items.
RelatedConnectionConveyNoExchangeItem=The Connection doesn't convey any exchange items.
RelatedFunctionalExchangeIsNotExternal=The functional exchange is not external.

SuperNull=Generalization super-element is null.
SubNull=Generalization sub-element is null.

Transition_UI_Cancel=User has canceled the selection.
