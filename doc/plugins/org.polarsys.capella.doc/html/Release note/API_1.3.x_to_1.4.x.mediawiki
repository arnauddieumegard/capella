= API changes from Capella 1.3.x to 1.4.x =

Please also refer to  [[../help/topic/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.html|Sirius Release Notes]].

== Major changes ==

=== Migration from Eclipse Oxygen to Eclipse 2019-06 ===
Capella 1.4.x is built with Eclipse 2019-06. 

=== New implementation for filtered trees ===
For better integration with Eclipse in the future and for better user experience, filtered tree in Capella is now inherited directly from Eclipse with customizations:

* The search is triggered only by hitting Enter
* The search is case insensitive

As a reminder, the filtered tree is used in the '''Capella Project Explorer''' view and many others wizards like '''Transfer Dialog''', '''Replicable Elements Dialog''', '''Delete Dialog''', etc

=== Refinement plug-ins have been removed; Projection plug-ins have been refactored ===

All plug-ins org.polarsys.capella.core.refinement.** have been completely removed because they were deprecated.

org.polarsys.capella.core.projection.** have been refactored in the following way:
* Only scenario/exchanges/interfaces/common plug-ins remain;
* Classes from commands plug-in have been moved to their appropriate packages.
