Please also refer to  [[../help/topic/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.html|Sirius Release Notes]].

== Major changes ==

=== Migration from Eclipse Oxygen to Eclipse 2019-06 ===
Capella 1.4.x is built with Eclipse 2019-06. 

=== New implementation for filtered trees ===
For better integration with Eclipse in the future and for better user experience, filtered tree in Capella is now inherited directly from Eclipse with customizations:

* The search is triggered only by hitting Enter
* The search is case insensitive

As a reminder, the filtered tree is used in the '''Capella Project Explorer''' view and many others wizards like '''Transfer Dialog''', '''Replicable Elements Dialog''', '''Delete Dialog''', etc
